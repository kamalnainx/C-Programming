// The preprocessor in c.
// The C preprocessor is a component of the C programming language that performs textual manipulations on the source code before it is compiled. It is a separate step in the compilation process that occurs before the actual compilation takes place.

// The C preprocessor is responsible for handling directives that start with a hash symbol (#) and providing functionality such as macro expansion, conditional compilation, file inclusion, and other preprocessing directives.

// Here are some key concepts and directives related to the C preprocessor:

// Macro expansion: Macros are defined using the #define directive and allow you to create symbolic names for constants, expressions, or code snippets. The preprocessor replaces each occurrence of a macro with its corresponding definition during preprocessing.

// Conditional compilation: The #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, and #endif directives are used for conditional compilation. They allow parts of the code to be selectively included or excluded based on certain conditions, such as the value of a defined macro.

// File inclusion: The #include directive is used to include the contents of another file in the current source file. It is often used to include header files that contain function prototypes, macros, and other declarations needed in the current source file.

// Predefined macros: The C preprocessor provides a set of predefined macros that can be used to obtain information about the compilation environment, such as the current line number (__LINE__), the name of the current file (__FILE__), and the current date and time of compilation (__DATE__ and __TIME__).

// Stringification and token concatenation: The # and ## operators allow you to manipulate and combine tokens during preprocessing. The # operator converts a token into a string literal, and the ## operator concatenates tokens to form new tokens.

// types of preprocess directives

// #define: Used to define a macro, which is a symbolic name for a constant value, an expression, or a code snippet.
// #undef: Used to undefine a previously defined macro.
// Conditional Compilation:

// #if, #elif, #else, #endif: Used for conditional compilation based on the evaluation of constant expressions.
// #ifdef, #ifndef: Used to conditionally include or exclude code blocks based on whether a macro is defined or not.
// File Inclusion:

// #include: Used to include the contents of another file in the current source file. It is typically used to include header files that contain function prototypes, macros, and other declarations.
// Line Control:

// #line: Used to change the line number and source file name reported by the compiler during error messages or debugging.
// Error Handling:

// #error: Used to generate a compiler error message with a user-defined error message.
// Pragma Directive:

// #pragma: Used to provide implementation-specific instructions to the compiler. Pragma directives are not part of the C standard, but they are supported by many compilers for specific purposes like compiler-specific options or optimization directives.
